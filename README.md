# CustomEQ
This is a EQ VST meant to have better low and high pass filters than the stock Ableton EQ 3/8


## What will this do
The standard EQ 8 has only a '48x' shelf option as the maximum. While technically fine, I find that when music production, I would want a 'vertical' line indicating a hard value on what to keep and what to 'EQ' out. This is mainly used for Subbass and Kick mixing, however, I have seen multiple Synths extend beyond the EQ filter when measuring the waveform in an oscilloscope.

So to keep a long story short. this VST will have the option for the user to have 90 degrees low and high pass filters rather than the normal 24/48 filters
